Viewport > html > body

Mind the difference between viewport and html, body in theimage below.

Here is an image to make it more clear

height: 100vh = 100% of the viewport height

height: 100%= 100% of the parent's element height

The viewport units are relative units, which means that they do not have an objective measurement. Instead, their size is determined by the size of the viewport.

What is The Viewport?
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
